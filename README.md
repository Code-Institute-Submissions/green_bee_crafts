## Goal for this Project
To create a functioning e-commerce site to present to a client.
The client is a sole trader who upcyles fabrics, pots and furniture in an ethical manner and sells them at craft fairs and online.
Currently online sales are low as the client has no website of their own and sells via ebay and facebook but with a dedicated website hopes to reduce costs and increase sales.
